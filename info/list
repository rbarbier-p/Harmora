- using ATmega32u4 for USB-MIDI. Using LUFA low-level framework to handle the USB.
- using mechanical keyboard style buttons (clean, easy, customisable)
- oled screen with as many utilities as possible. what will it display? (then choose a size)
- 2 octaves piano to play some melodies? also adding a pitch shifter for that. (probably just one octave, switch between chord mode and melody, will handle the outside the key chords latter in software).
- in the piano, use magnetic keyboard push buttons for mesuring velocity (they have hall sensors)
- using SysEx (system exclusive) adding to MCU (Mackie Control Universal) to send more complex messages through midi.
Controlling things like pause/play, record, track selection, feedback on volume and much more.
- having LEDs to display those feedbacks
- voicing dial and bass voicing dial (orchid like)
- joystick to control the chord type?
